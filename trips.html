<h2>West Palm Beach, FL</h2>

<div class="row">

<div class="col-xs-7">
West Palm Beach offers drift diving off boats and easy walk-in shore diving with no current at the world famous <a href="http://www.puravidadivers.com/dive-blue-heron-bridge-phil-foster-park" target="_blank">Blue Heron Bridge</a>. Divers on West Palm Beach trips have swum with sea turtles, goliath groupers, rays, eels, octopi, bull sharks, lemon sharks, nurse sharks, and more!  I offer two trips to West Palm Beach:  Open Water, and Advanced.  I can take up to 10 students on certification trips.</p>

<h4>Key Largo, FL</h4>

<div class="row">

<div class="col-xs-8">

<p>For Key Largo I typically participate in <a href="http://venturetrek.com/" target="_blank">Venturetrek</a>'s Key Largo trip, which runs about once per quarter (for an example, see <a href="http://venturetrek.com/keylargo_12-5.html" target="_blank">the December 2014 trip</a>). This trip offers eight dives on privately chartered <a href="http://www.keylargodiving.com/" target="_blank">Quiescence</a> boats, including a twilight dive, night dive, and deep dive to one of the many great shipwrecks in Key Largo.  Venturetrek's Key Largo trips are priced in the $500 to $700 range, depending on whether you include apartment lodging or certification fees.  If you want a Key Largo trip but can't make one of Venturetrek's trips, I can put together a trip with <a href="http://www.keylargodiving.com/" target="_blank">Quiescence</a> or <a href="http://www.rainbowreef.us/">Rainbow Reef</a>.</p>

<h4>Destin, FL and Panama City, FL</h4>

The Florida panhandle offers decent ocean diving (though a far cry from south Florida) and is easy to get to by car, making a 2-day weekend certification trip possible.  Vortex Spring is nearby and offers the option to do the first 2 or 3 certification dives in an easy walk-in spring (though Vortex Spring is very cold - 68 F).

<h4>Central Florida Springs</h4>

There are several fresh water springs near Gainesville, FL, which is an easy five-hour drive from Atlanta.  These springs feature crystal clear 72 F water year-round and some of them are pretty fun dives (like Devil's Den).  Camping is avilable at these springs, offering the possibility of very inexpensive lodging.

<h3>Local Certification Options</h3>

<p>
  If you don't have the time or money to devote to a Florida trip, or you simply need to complete your certification quickly, there are several local options.  Note that these local bodies of fresh water can be quite cold in the winter.
