# West Palm Beach 2-day OW Cert Dive Plan

*Dive flexible* skills are in *italics*

## Day 1 - Blue Heron Bridge

### Open Water Dive 1

At the surface:

1. Brief signals for “okay,” “something is wrong,” “ear problem,” “low air,” “up/ end the dive,” “stay with your buddy,” and the audible and visual signal for “look at me.”
2. Put on and adjust equipment – using proper lifting techniques.
3. Perform a predive safety check.
4. Enter the water with BCD inflated to provide positive buoyancy.
5. Check and adjust weighting

Underwater:

6. Descend with control and reference using a descent line or sloping bottom contour to a depth not greater than 12 metres/40 feet.
7. Participate in a trim check.
8. ** Partial mask clear** Clear a partially flooded mask.
9. ** Reg recovery & clear*** Recover and clear the regulator at depth.
10. Explore the dive site.
11. Signal whether remaining air supply is near designated caution zone, and/or indicate air supply in bar/psi.
12. Stay close enough to make physical contact with buddy within two seconds.
13. Ascend no faster than 18 metres/60 feet per minute while maintaining buddy contact. Use the five point method

### Surface skills during surface interval

- *Cramp Release*
- *Tired Diver Tow*
- *Inflatable Signal Tube Use*
- *Snorkel/Regulator Exchange*
- *Remove and Replace Weight System and Scuba Kit*
- *Emergency Weight Drop*

### Open Water Dive 2

At the surface:

1. Plan the dive, including air supply management/
turn pressure, time limits, entries and exits, buddy separation procedures and basic emergency procedures.
2. Put on, adjust and streamline equipment. Use proper lifting techniques.
3. Perform a predive safety check.
4. Adjust weighting and trim, as necessary.
5. When at the surface, establish positive buoyancy, keep the mask on and breathe from the snorkel or regulator.
6. **Oral BCD inflation** Deflate BCD, then orally inflate it until positively buoyant in water too deep in which to stand.

Underwater:

7. Descend using a descent line or sloping bottom contour for control and reference to a depth not greater than 12 metres/40 feet. Use the five-point method.
8. **Neutral buoyancy using LPI** Become neutrally buoyant by adjusting air in the BCD (or dry suit) with the low pressure inflator.
9. **Full mask clear** Clear a fully flooded mask.
10. **OOA** Perform each role: In a stationary position, one person signals “out of air” and secures and breathes from an alternate air source provided by another diver; the other diver provides the air source.
11. **AAO Ascent** Ascend properly using an alternate air source and establish positive buoyancy at the surface. Act as either donor or receiver.
12. Explore the dive site.
13. Avoid contact with sensitive organisms and the bottom, and resecure any equipment that becomes loose.
14. Stay close enough to make physical contact with buddy within two seconds.
15. Indicate remaining air supply within 20 bar/300 psi without rechecking the SPG.
16. Signal air remaining at intervals assigned during dive planning.
17. Ascend no faster than 18 metres/60 feet per minute while maintaining buddy contact. Use the five-point method (unless ascending using the alternate air source ascent.) Make a safety stop if feasible.

At the surface:

- *Straight Line Surface Swim With Compass*

## Day 2 - Blue Heron Bridge

### Open Water Dive 3

At the surface:

1. Plan the dive.
2. Put on, adjust and streamline equipment. Use proper lifting techniques.
3. Perform a predive safety check.
4. Adjust weighting and trim, as necessary.
5. When at the surface, establish positive buoyancy, keep the mask on and breathe from the snorkel or regulator.

Underwater:

- *Compass Navigation*
- *CESA*


6. Descend with a visual reference for control to no greater than 18 metres/60 feet. Use the five-point method.
7. Become neutrally buoyant and hover by inflating the BCD orally.
8. Remove, replace and clear the mask.
9. Explore the dive site.
10. Avoid contact with sensitive organisms and the bottom, and resecure any equipment that becomes loose.
11. Stay close enough to make physical contact with buddy within two seconds.
12. Indicate remaining air supply within 20 bar/300 psi without rechecking the SPG.
13. Signal air remaining at intervals assigned during dive planning.
14. Ascend no faster than 18 metres/60 feet per minute while maintaining buddy contact. Use the five-point method. Make a safety stop if feasible.

## Day 2 - Drift Dive Charter Boat

### Open Water Dive 4

At the surface:

1. As a buddy team, plan the dive using the PADI Skill Practice and Dive Planning Slate.
2. Put on, adjust and streamline equipment. Use proper lifting techniques.
3. Perform a predive safety check.
4. Adjust weighting and trim, as necessary.
5. When at the surface, establish positive buoyancy, keep the mask on and breathe from the snorkel or regulator

Underwater:

6. Descend with no visual reference to no greater than 18 metres/60 feet. Use the five-point method.
7. With a buddy, explore the dive site.
8. Avoid contact with sensitive organisms and the bottom, and resecure any equipment that becomes loose.
9. Stay close enough to make physical contact with buddy within two seconds.
10. Indicate remaining air supply within 20 bar/300 psi without rechecking the SPG.
11. With a buddy, signal when to turn the dive and when
to ascend, based on air supply or time per the dive plan, and take appropriate action.
12. Ascend no faster than 18 metres/60 feet per minute while maintaining buddy contact. Use the five-point method. Make a safety stop.
