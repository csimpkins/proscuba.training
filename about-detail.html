<p>I believe that scuba diving is transformative, and I want to share the experience with as many people I can.  Diving makes your life better.  It exposes you to a realm few people get to see up close and changes your perspective on the world we live in.<p/>

<p>Choosing your instructor is the most important dive training decision you'll make. Some instructors have been all over the world and can bring you an international perspective.  Some instructors are experienced technical divers or cave divers who can show you that path.  My specialty is teaching, and my teaching philosophy can be summarized as:</p>

<blockquote>
  If you want to learn, I will do whatever I can to teach you.
</blockquote>

<p>I've helped students overcome swimming deficiencies, discomfort with water up their noses, understanding dive theory, and trouble with specific diving skills.  I believe diving is for <em>everyone</em> who is medically fit to dive.</p>

<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>

I love teaching, and I have devoted the majority of my professional career to it.  A common thread in my teaching experience is a focus on building foundations for students who are new to a field or activity.  Here are the ways in which my non-scuba teaching experience contributes to my approach to dive training.

<h3>Air Force T-37 Instructor Pilot</h3>

<p>I was an Air Force T-37 instructor pilot for three years.  The T-37 is the first jet students flew in Air Force pilot training. We "Tweet IPs" had a saying: "T-37 instructors teach them how to fly, T-38 instructors teach them how to fly T-38s."  In other words, we take students who are completely new to flying and turn them into military pilots from the ground up.  We instill the discipline, attention to detail, checklist procedures, habit patterns and general airmanship that students will rely on in every plane they ever fly.</p>

<p>Scuba diving has much in common with flying.  Like flying, we require special equipment to allow us to operate in an environment humans aren't designed to inhabit.  We must learn how to adapt our bodies to changes in ambient pressure and air density.  We must meet certain standards to ensure dive safety and may employ many techniques to meet those standards.  Like flying, developing the proper habits and attitides allows us to enjoy diving safely.  And finally, as a T-37 instructor pilot the lives of my students depended on me.  Understanding this responsiblity and taking it seriously is habit for me.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.teamusa.org/usa-wrestling">USA Wrestling</a> <a href="http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Wrestling/Membership/Coaches.aspx">Bronze Certified</a> Youth Wrestling Coach</h3>

<p>I was a youth wrestling coach for three years and learned a great deal about teaching and coaching kids.  When you teach 8 year-old children how to wrestle you must start with basic principles and break everything down into very simple parts. They don't even know what wrestling <em>is</em> or, worse, they think it's what they see on TV. You must understand that they don't have the same body control as older kids and adults.  They don't have the same attention span.  They have different sensitivites.  They have parents who are screaming at them to "stop crying and suck it up!" and you have to help them (and their parents) understand <em>why</em> they're crying and how to properly deal with it.  It's hard work, but it's tremendous fun and the development you see in your young athletes is inspiring.</p>

<p>Children as young as 10 can become certified scuba divers.  But you can't teach a 10 year-old the same way you would teach an adult.  Just like youth wrestlers they have attention span, body awareness, and apprehensions about the water that you have deal with with sensitivity and understanding.  Some of my most cherished experiences are diving with my own kids.  I relish the thought of helping other families share the same kinds of experiences underwater.</p>

<h3>Air Force Space Instructor</h3>

<p>I was an Air Force Undergraduate Space Training instructor for three years.  All Air Force space operators attend Undergraduate Space Training (UST) in which they learn, among other things, the physics related to orbiting satellites, intercontinental missiles, and space launch vehicles.  But there is <em>no technical degree requirement for space operators</em>.  So in UST I taught English majors the basics of Newtonian physics (gravity, force, mass, acceleration, etc.) in a purely conceptual manner.  I couldn't simply throw equations on the board and go through dozens of problems using them.  I had to develop an intuitive understanding of physics in my students, and I was the most successful instructor in all of UST at doing this!  (Carl Sagan had a great saying that goes something like "if you can't explain something to an 8 year-old, you don't understand it yourself."  I love that saying.)</p>

<p>Although you don't need to be technically savvy to learn how to scuba dive safely and proficiently (10 year olds can dive after all!), you do need to understand some basic theory related to buoyancy and the behavior of liquids and gasses under pressure.  I can help you develop an intuitive understanding of dive theory without bogging you down in technical details.</p>


<h3>Lecturer of Computer Science at <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~simpkins/">Georgia Tech</a></h3>

<p>Some students with a technical background want a deeper understanding of dive theory.  Being such a student myself, I can help my students develop this deeper understanding.</p>


<!--
A common thread in my teaching experience is that I have mostly focused on building foundations for learners who are new to a field or activity.  I teach first-year computer science students, the T-37 is the first jet students flew in Air Force pilot training, and when you teach 8 year-old children how to wrestle you must start with basic principles and build from there.  A apply this experience to my scuba instruction.  I understand that adapting to the underwater realm is totally new for most people.  I have experience teaching children.  I undertand technical details and know how to help other understand them.  And I have extensive experience in teaching students how to operate complex equipment that their lives depend on and develop the habit patterns that lead to maximal safety and enjoyment.
