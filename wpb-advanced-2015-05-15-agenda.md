## Agenda

Diving at the Blue Heron Bridge is highly dependent on tides and boat charters typically leave on time, so it's very important to plan ahead and stay on schedule.  Each West Palm Beach trip is planned for the specific tide predictions and boat schedules in effect for that particular weekend.
